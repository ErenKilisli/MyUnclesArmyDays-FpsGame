My Uncle's Military Memories is one of the projects I enjoyed doing the most. The Doom clone game, whose programming, game and level design made by me, is a retro FPS. There are 8 different weapons and 11 different enemies.

The game consists of a DEMO map and the demo map consists of 3 parts. To pass each part, you collect the blue, orange and red key from that part respectively. Games different from the classic Doom, different bosses and difficulties appear in each section. Like hell section(filled with enemies), mazes etc.

Assets were taken from many different places, but they were never used for commercial purposes and those with permission were taken.
