My Uncle's Military Memories is one of the projects I enjoyed doing the most. The Doom clone game, whose programming, game and level design made by me, is a retro FPS. There are 8 different weapons and 11 different enemies.

Assets were taken from many different places, but they were never used for commercial purposes and those with permission were taken.
